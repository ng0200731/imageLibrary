### Issue Description

A user reported a significant discrepancy between the model name displayed in the Augment UI ('Claude Sonnet') and the full model name ('Claude 3 Sonnet').

### User Impact

This inconsistency caused confusion and led the user to believe the service was being deceptive, eroding trust in the product.

### Expected Behavior

The model name displayed in the user interface should be precise and match the full name of the underlying model to ensure transparency and clarity.

### Actionable Feedback

The Augment engineering team should update the UI to display the full, accurate model name (e.g., 'Claude 3 Sonnet') to prevent confusion for all users.
