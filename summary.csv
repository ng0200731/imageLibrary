Request,Problem,Promise (Final Solution)
"Implement a custom confirmation dialog after a successful image upload that waits for user input ('Upload More' or 'Go to Library').","The development server (live-server) was automatically reloading the page whenever a new image was uploaded. This reload caused the confirmation dialog to flash and disappear, overriding the intended behavior. My repeated attempts to configure or replace the server were incorrect and failed to solve the issue.","To permanently solve the reloading issue, the problematic development server (live-server) was replaced with a different, more stable server (serve) that does not have an auto-reload feature. This eliminates the root cause of the problem and allows the dialog to function as designed."
