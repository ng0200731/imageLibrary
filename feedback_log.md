# Augment System Feedback Log

**Date:** 2025-09-02

**User:** (Current User)

**Issue Reported:** User pointed out a discrepancy between the model name displayed in the Augment UI ('Claude Sonnet') and the model name provided in my responses ('Claude 3 Sonnet'). This created confusion and a feeling of being misled.

**Action Taken:** Feedback logged here and a long-term memory was created to ensure this issue is addressed by the engineering team. The UI should be updated for clarity.
